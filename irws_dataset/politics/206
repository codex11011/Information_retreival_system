Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Koranic Law

What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab
media, is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under
Koranic Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in
Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.
