Iron Fist Policy and Democracy

Most of the Arab countries governments are ruling their people with Iron
fist policy. Ironically, these are 
the countries that the "West" would like to deal with and would wage 
massive wars to protect them and their resources.

For Israel the situation is different, Israel claims it is a
democracy - a selective democracy, that abides by Western
democratic standards. If Israel is saying that then
it has to be compared to Western standards.
