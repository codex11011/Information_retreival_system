Peace Talks between Israel and the Palestinians

Israel Radio, KOL YISRAEL, reports on
the bilateral peace talks, following a recess which
lasted over four months. According to the report, Israel is
expected to offer the Palestinians new proposals regarding the
authority of the Palestinian Executive Council, general elections,
control over land and human rights issues in the Territories.
Israel will express its readiness to give the Palestinians control
of more land than previously offered. According to the radio
report, one estimate is that Israel will give the Palestinians
control over as much as two thirds of the administered lands, as
well as broad authority on water issues. Israel will seek to
promote its offer to hold elections in the Territories in hopes of
strengthening the position of the Palestinian delegation to the
peace negotiations. According to Israel Radio, the Israeli
delegation to the bilateral talks with the Palestinians will offer
greater responsibilities to the Palestinian Executive Council
allowing it certain legislative capabilities, without making it a
symbol for Palestinian sovereignty. Head of the American team at the bilateral peace talks,
Edward Djerejian, said that tonight's gathering is meant to
demonstrate the U.S.' active role in the peace process.
