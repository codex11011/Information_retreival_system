Israel invading Lebanon

Certainly the Palestine Liberation Oraganization did shell Northern
Israel from the Arqoub region, but Israel did much more shelling
destroying several villages in South Lebanon. Both sides exchanged
shelling, with occasional aerial raids by Israel on the villages
of Lebanon.

Israel had many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government
in Lebanon favourable to Israel, and it nearly achieved this aim
with the election of Basheer El Gemayel, and his brother, Amin
El Gemayel, but the internal situation in Lebanon was too hard
to control and predict so Israel had to withdraw.
