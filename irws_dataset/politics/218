difference between guerrilla warfare and terrorism

There is a difference between guerrilla warfare and terrorism.
The former primarily targets enemy soldiers.  The latter primarily
targets civilians, and not necessarily enemy civilans, at that.

"The Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
soldiers." 

Innocent British soldiers?  Like innocent Iraqi soldiers?
The British were EXECUTING Jewish fighters in what was soon to become
the recognized Jewish homeland.  The British - to their eternal shame
and damnation - were sending shiploads of Jewish refugees, civilians,
back to Europe to be taken care of by Hitler.
