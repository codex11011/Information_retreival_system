Civil War

The United States police kill as many blacks as Israel kills Palestinians,
even though the US black population, while admittedly larger, isn't engaged in 
a civil war to attempt to destroy the government.

Civil war has to be handled nicer. You cannot say the
Palestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreign
nation and still call Israel a government who is treating its own people
cruelly. If the Palestinians are fighting a war against a foreign country,
so is Israel, and the gloves come off.
