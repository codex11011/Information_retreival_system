Number of people killed by Israel

Anybody has any information about the number of the people have been 
killed by Israel during these 44 years.
 
"Not sure.  But the number of Israelis killed defending Israel is a little more
than 17,000 in the last 44 years and 61,000 injured."

Does this mean that the number of the people that have been killed by Israel are so
high that you can not keep the track of, or this is also a part of Zionism 
ideology that you don't need to keep  the track of the people you kill? 
Just kill!
