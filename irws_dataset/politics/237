Jewish culture or Jewish religion for Jewish Nation?

To be a part or not of the Jewish Nation is defined by my culture and not
by my religion. Actually, if I am an atheist, which is in fact like 
converting into a non-Jewish in terms of religion, I am still considered as
part of the Jewish Nation.

I can be proud of my Jewish culture while not giving any importance to the
Jewish religion. Or, even more, I can be proud of my Jewish culture while
still be convinced that the real god is another one.
