Deir Yassin threat to Jewish citizens in Jerusalem?

Unlike the Palestine Liberation Organization's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets, the
100 troops from the Irgun and Stern group that struck at Deir Yassin
on April 10, 1948, targeted the village for its military importance.
Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem, which the Arabs had
blockaded, and it housed Iraqi troops and Palestinian irregulars.
Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens
in Jerusalem.
