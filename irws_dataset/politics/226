Is UN biased when it tries to condemn Israel?

The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its
gross violation of human rights.

The UN has also failed to condemn gross violations of human
rights in many other places around the globe and in the middle east,
thus leading many people to conclude that the UN is biased in whom it
chooses to condemn.
