The Holocaust
 
All Jews suffered during WWII, not just our beloved who perished or were 
tortured.  We all suffered.  
 
All humans suffered emotionally, some Jews and many
others suffered physically. 

There were a great many Germans, Poles and others who did not
sympathize with the victims of the Holocaust but instead participated
with enthusiasm in the killing.

The Holocaust wasn't a massacre, it wasn't even killing for sport; it
was an entire Industry of Death.  German engineers, architects,
technicians and bureaucrats proudly put their best efforts into as
efficient and methodical a Killing Machine as they could devise and
operate.  And it certainly was something extraordinary.
