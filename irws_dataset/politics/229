Palestinean and Zionist fighters

"By comparison, Palestinean fighters primarily target tourists,
school children, babies, worshippers, shoppers, movie-goers and other
such threatening people. Early Zionist fighters did no such things."

This is historically incorrect.  Early Zionist fighters did indeed
target civilians.  They made random attacks in Arab marketplaces,
killing innocent passers-by. Anyone can read about the history of
the Zionist terrorists.
