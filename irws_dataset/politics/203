Civil Libertarians

I don't know what you call a "Civil Libertarian" but I know only
one thing: if all of them think like you do it, then "Civil Libertarians"
is a new denomination for Antisemites. May other Civil Libertarians come
to word to this group so that we can learn if A.Beyer and me are right
(that Civil Libertarians are Antisemites)
Actually, Civil Libertarians believe in the fundamental
freedoms that belong to human beings.
