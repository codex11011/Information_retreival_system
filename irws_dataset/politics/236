Israeli Media

Since I read both American media
and Israeli media, I can say with absolute certainty that anybody
who relies exclusively on the American press for knowledge about
Israel does not have a true picture of what is going on.

The Jerusalem Post is only a small part of the Israeli media.

If you never read Ha'aretz, Maariv, or other Hebrew langauge papers,
or at least seen some of their articles translated, you are not
really getting the Israeli media.

As to the claim that Israeli media are biased, of course they
are.  Some may lean to the right or the left, just like the media
here in America.  But they still report events about which people
here know nothing.  I choose to form my opinions about Israel and
the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average American
who relies exclusively on an American media which does not report
on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy.
