Jewish diaspora

Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,
launched a ferocious attack on Jewish diaspora at a Zionist Youth
Council meeting in North London.

The diaspora, he claimed, "was the cancer connected to the main
tissue of the Jewish people". He was scathing about its failure to
act before the Holocaust.

Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,
unlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the
country they lived in, he said.

He warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish
people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in
literary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English
language.
