Racial Discrimination by Israel

Zionism predicates a state
where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,
a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak
Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli
citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be
Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial
discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only
reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the
very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.

Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that
does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -
that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed
to fail.
