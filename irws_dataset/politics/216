Israeli treatment of the Palestinians and the Holocaust

The Israeli treatment of the Palestinians can't be compared with the Holocaust.
The Nazis didn't start with the Holocaust and their
initial actions were similar to what the Israelis are doing with the Palestinians.
	
The Jews that were stranded on the Polish border since
no country accepted them are like the Arabs stranded on the
Lebanese border. No trials, no hearing, just expulsion based on
guilt due to race.
