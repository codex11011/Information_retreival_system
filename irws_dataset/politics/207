ex-Soviet Armenian Government in 1914

"Thanks to those who joined millions of Turkish and Kurdish people 
on April 23, 1993 when they remembered, mourned and prayed for 2.5 
million Muslim people who were ruthlessly exterminated by the fascist 
ex-Soviet Armenian Government between 1914 and 1920."

I tend to doubt this for there was no ex-Soviet Armenian government between
1914 and 1920! Revisionist, liar, AND fool!
