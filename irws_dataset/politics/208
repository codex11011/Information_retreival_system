Israeli terrorism

Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism
during the 1930's and 1940's.  The Irgun, and other branches
of militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of
Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of
terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
soldiers, but not only that, they also killed many Jews who were in
favour of a compromise with the Palestinians.
