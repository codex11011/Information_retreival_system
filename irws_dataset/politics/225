Jews in Arab Countries

There are still small communities of Jews left
in some Arab countries. Morocco has the largest group I think comprising
perhaps just over a thousand Jews. There are communities of Jews left in
Yemen (which went to the polls yesterday in what might appear to be a
free-ish election), Algeria (this is a tiny group, a couple of leftist
intellectuals), and of course Syria and Lebanon.

The circumstances of the departure of the Jews from various Arab countries
is controversial in some cases - like Iraq.
