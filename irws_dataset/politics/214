Changes in Israeli Society
 
Prime Minister Rabin said that enforcing Jewish sovereignty over the entire Land of
Israel would lead to the establishment of a bi-national state. "I
would view it as if the historical destiny of my generation, Dor
Tashach, the generation that had the great privilege of determining
the fate of the people and founding the Jewish state, had been
lost."  Rabin added, "We must stop dreaming of settlements [i.e. in
the Territories] and focus on qualitative and substantive changes
in Israeli society to make it a productive society dependent on its
own labour." The Prime Minister concluded saying that he would like
to achieve a significant breakthrough in the peace process during
his government's term.
