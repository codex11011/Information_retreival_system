Relations between Jews and Muslims in Sarajevo, Bosnia

Sarajevo, Bosnia - In this land of historic hatreds, a tiny
Jewish community is braving Serbian shells to repay a 50-year-old debt to
Muslims who saved Jews from the Holocaust.
 
Ivica Ceresnjes, president of the Jewish Community in Sarajevo,
said that was partly in gratitude to the Muslims who hid Jews during
the Nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuries-old presence of 
Jews living in Sarajevo.
 
While Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mid-east, Jews here
say there's a long tradition of cooperation, inter-marriage and
tolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to
centuries of Turkish occupation.
 
During the Holocaust, many of the Jews were
hidden by Muslims in Mostar.
