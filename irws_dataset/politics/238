Treatment to Synagogues in the Jewish quarter

One should compare this treatment of Israelis to mosques with the one given to synagogues in the
Jewish quarter in 1948, when it fell under Arab dominion.  22 of the
27 synagogues were burned down by mobs, and the other 5 synagogues were razed by
the Jordanian army.  I think that in comparison the Israelis have done
an excellent, but certainly not perfect, job at maintaining Arab
mosques.
