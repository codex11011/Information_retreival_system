Mosque in Jewish quarter

It is important to note that there remains at least one mosque in the
Jewish quarter of the Old City, at least according to my map.  You
might be able to find it just north of the Hurva synagogue.

When I was in Jerusalem a couple of years ago, our guide told
us the story of that mosque - not sure if it was true.

Apparently, it was built by a Jewish convert to Islam.  He had
had a dispute with his neighbours, and built the mosque to
annoy them.
