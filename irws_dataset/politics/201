Deir Yassin

Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on
the part of the Jews, and a massacre defines it best in my
opinion.  The village of Deir Yassin had had a pact with the
Jews, a peace pact, but the Irgun purposely broke this
agreement in order to scare off the Palestinians.  I might
grant that this village housed armed Arabs but
nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that
this was a motivating force amongst the Irgun.  The Deir Yassin
MASSACRE was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the
Palestinians to flee the Jewish Homeland, and contrary to
your belief, many civilians were killed.  Deir Yassin was later
advertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was
useful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinians
were rightfully scared off, because they did not want another
Deir Yassin.
