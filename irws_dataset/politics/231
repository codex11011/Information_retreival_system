Peace negotiations and Fundamentalism

The Palestinians have all to gain from the peace negotiations.
Fundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories, then it will be
too late to discuss issues with the Palestinians since they will only
vow for the destruction of Israel.

Arabs  must take example on Egypt. Egypt came to the bargaining table,
got what it wanted from Israel and there is now peace and cooperation
between the two countries.
