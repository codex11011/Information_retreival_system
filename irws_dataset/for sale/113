For Sale: Records (Beatles, Cream, Woodstock)

I have a stack of records LP 33 that are from the early sixties to mid seventies
with groups like the Beatles, Cream, Woodstock (triple album) etc. that I
would like to get rid of.  I would be willing to sell one or all for whatever
reasonable offer.  Some records still have the original wrapper and price tag.
I would like to get around $5 for each or you can call and make offer on the
lot.  I could list them all but I'd be typing forever.
