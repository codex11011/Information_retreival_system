For Sale: Cheap hard disks for your PC/XT
 
I have a few of the original IBM 10Mb hard disks for sale. They are actually
Seagate's ST412, MFM, full height,  has the IBM logo and black face plate.
 
Each hard disk is checked and formatted with DOS 5.0. It can be doubled to 
20Mb or so with dblspace or stacker if you so desire.  Have the original IBM
foam fitted boxes and anti-static bags. I am not sure if they were ever 
used, but each drive that is sent out will be guaranteed in good working order.

$30 each plus shipping cost, (about $5).
