For Sale: Shirts!

I purchased 256 shirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through. 
We didn't have the time to sell the shirts.  I have about 175 shirts
left and I am willing to sell them to you for $5.25 a piece (more than a
dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts,
even in bulk)  (That's $918.75 for 175 shirts)  These shirts are from Jim
Morris.  They are all 100% cotton and most have more than 4
colors.  (They are clean and neatly folded in a box.  If any happen to
be damaged I will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace
it, your option.)  You could sell them for at least $8 to $15 a piece
(the higher number is for the nicer shirts) to raise money for a school
event or a organization.  I realize it is a big investment, but it could
pay off big.
