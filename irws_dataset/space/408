Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission

If re-boosting the Hubble Space Telescope by carrying it with a shuttle would not damage it,
then why couldn't Hubble Space Telescope be brought back to earth and the servicing job done
here?

Is it because two shuttle flights would be required, adding to the alredy
horrendous expense?
