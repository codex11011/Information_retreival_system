history of spacecraft

This text is a history of the spacecraft as both a cultural and a
technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the
space between worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the
latter half of this century.  The need preceded the ability to make
such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized
that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to
reach them.
