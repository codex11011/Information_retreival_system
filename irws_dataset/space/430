The Forever War

"The Forever War", one of my favorite Sci-Fi books, had a passage devoted to 
breathable fluids. The idea was to protect people from the high accelerations 
required for interstellar travel by immersing the passengers in dry-cleaning 
fluid saturated with oxygen. Plenty of very imaginative ideas in this book.
I would certainly recommend it (won the Hugo and the Nebula awards).
