Satellite around Pluto

Is there a plan to put a satellite around Pluto to keep watch?

How about a mission to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things
around and near and on Pluto. I know it is a strange idea, but why not?
It could do some scanning of not only Pluto, but also of the solar system,
objects near and around Pluto, as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy
without having much of the solar system to worry about.
