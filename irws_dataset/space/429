Jet Propulsion Laboratory

Jet Propulsion Laboratory's history dates back to 
to the 1930s when a Caltech professor named Von Karman conducted  
experiments in rocket PROPULSION with a group of graduate students
on the present site of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.   The Army started
funding the laboratory and had jurisdiction untill the late 1950s when
NASA took over. The early research conducted at the Laboratory
led to many applications, the first being Jet-assisted takeoff rockets
for aircraft.  I think this should explain where Jet Propulsion Laboratory got it's name.
