Pluto and Chiron

He notes that the two recently discovered "Kuiper Belt" objects,
1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same 
mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the
larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Chiron.  Pluto/Chiron, he thinks,
formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material
into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Chiron; similar to
ideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidence
from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Chiron are very different
(Pluto has methane frost, Chiron doesn't), which can be used as evidence
for the impact theory.
