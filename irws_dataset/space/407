Rankings of SPACE mailing list

About three weeks ago on the SPACE mailing list, someone was quoting a source on the
relative traffic and rankings of this list.  A figure of 88th in
traffic was given.  Unfortunately I did not clip the message and I would
like to know the source of the rankings list.
