Interstellar radiation field

The (local) interstellar
radiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups.
The models involved contributions from three
different BB sources, so there's no obvious "temperature" of background
radiation in our local area. The
interstellar radiation density is a function of wavelength, and you can
integrate and average in an appropriate manner to get an "effective"
temperature if you like.
