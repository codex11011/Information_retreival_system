Commercials on the Moon

I have often thought about commercials on the moon. If it's possible to have a powerful laser
on earth, to light at the Moon, and show lasergraphics at the surface
so clearly that you can see it with your eyes when there is a new
moon.

How about a Coca Cola logo at the moon? Easy way to target billions of
people.
