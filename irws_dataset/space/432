Rocket with particle propulsion system

The other week I saw a TV program about the american space industry and NASA.
It said that in the 60's they developed a rocket that used ions or nuclear
particles for propulsion.
The government however, didn't give them $1 billion for the developement
of a full scale rocket.

Has anybody heard of the particle propulsion system?
