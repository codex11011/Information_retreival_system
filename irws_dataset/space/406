Long Distance Space Projects

I know that a lot of how people think and act in a long distance space project
would be much like old time explorers, sailors, hunters and such who spent a lot
of time alone, isolated, and alone or in minimal surroundings
such as the old arctic and antarctic expeditions and such.
