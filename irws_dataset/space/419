breathable liquid

They showed a large glass full of this liquid, and put a white mouse in
it.  Since the liquid was not dense, the mouse would float, so it was held down
by tongs clutching its tail.  The thing struggled quite a bit, but it was
certainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid.  It never
did slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top.
 
Now, this may not have been the most humane of demonstrations, but it certainly
shows breathable liquid can be made.
