blackbody temperature

I am not talking about the temperature of the Microwave Background
Radiation (MBR).  There are more things in the sky than just the MBR; what I'm
after is total blackbody temperature - what a thermal radiator would see,
disregarding (or shielding against) the Sun and nearby large warm objects.
My dim recollection is that the net effective temperature is substantially
higher than that of the MBR, once you figure in things like stars and the
zodiacal light, but I'd like numbers.
