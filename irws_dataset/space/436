Inflatable Space Dock

Why not build an inflatable space dock?

Basically deploy one side of the space dock (using a scissor shaped structure),
then maneuver the side to next to the satellite and then
move the rest of the dock around the satellite and seal it.
Then inflate the dock with a gas (is does not have to be oxygen, just neeeds to
be non-flameble, non-damaging to the satellite and able to maintain heat),
then heat the space dock (for the astronaut who will be working on the satellite
to be able to not have to wear the normal bulky space suit, but a much striped
down one).
