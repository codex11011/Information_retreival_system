Faith in Christ

I found it more than coincidental that less than 2 weeks after
I put my faith in Christ where my mouth was, one more in the long line of doctors
and not even an orthopeodic specialist, diagnosed my problems with no
difficulty, set me on the path to an effective cure, and I was walking
and running again without the pain that had stopped me from that for
4 years. The diagnosis was something he felt the other doctors must have
"overlooked" because it was perfectly obvious from my test results.
Maybe this doesn't hit you as miraculous. But to me it really
is. Imagine an active 17 year old being told she may not be able to
walk mcuh longer, and is now a happy 18 year old who can dance and run
knowing that the problem was there all along and was "revealed" just
after she did what she knew was right.
