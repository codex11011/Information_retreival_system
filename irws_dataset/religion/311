Bible, God and His purpose

When the Protestant reformers opposed and subsequently separated from the  
Church of Rome, the battle cry of the new protesting religion was "The  
Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible". Underlying that cry  
was a theory that if people could read the Bible for themselves in their  
native tongue they would discover the truth about God and His purpose.  
They would shed their old errors and be united by a common faith.
