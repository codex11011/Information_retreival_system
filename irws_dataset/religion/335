Who is God to impose its rules on us?

In his infinite wisdom, God made it perfectly clear that if we don't live
according to his rules, we will burn in hell. Well, with what RIGHT can god
make that desicion? 

Who is God to impose its rules on us? Who can tell if god is REALLY so
righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all hristians a flock of sheep,
unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?
