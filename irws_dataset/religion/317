Logic and Ability to Reason

The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to. 
But think about it for a minute.  Would you rather have someone love
you because you made them love you, or because they wanted to
love you. The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step towards
Him.  He promises to be there for you, but you have to look for yourself.
Those who doubt this or dispute it have not given it a sincere effort.
Simple logic arguments are folly.  If you read the Bible you will see
that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with "logic".
Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation.  Yet some think it is
the ultimate.  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never
know more than you do now.  To learn you must accept that which
you don't know.
