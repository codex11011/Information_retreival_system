Moral or immoral?

What exactly is morality or moral?  I never thought of eating meat to be moral 
or immoral, but I think it could be.  How do we differentiate between not doing 
something because it is a personal choice or preference and not doing something 
because we see it as immoral? Do we fall to what the basis of these morals are?

If whatever is right is what is societally mandated then whoever is in control
at the time makes what is right.
