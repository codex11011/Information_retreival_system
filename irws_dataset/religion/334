Burden of Proof

The default condition, in the absence of a preponderance of
evidence either way, is that the proposition or assertion is undecidable.
And the person who takes the undecidable position and says that he/she
simply disbelieves that the proposition is true, is the only one who
holds no burden of proof.  This is why the so-called "weak atheist"
position is virtually unassailable - not because it stands on a firm
foundation of logical argument, but because it's proponents simply
disbelieve in the existence of God and therefore they hold no burden
of proof.  When you don't assert anything, you don't have to prove
anything.  That's where weak atheism draws its strength.  But its
strength is also its Achilles' heel.  Without assertions/axioms, one
has no foundation upon which to build.  As a philosophy, it's virtually
worthless.
