Theism and Fanaticism

Theism is correlated with fanaticism. I have neither said that all fanaticism
is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanaticism. The point is,
theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic. One could of course
argue that would-be fanatics tend towards theism (for example), but I just
have to look at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology
to invalidate that conclusion that is the basic mechanism behind it.
