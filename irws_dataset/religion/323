Society and Morality

I believe that morality is subjective.  Each person is entitled to his
own moral attitudes.  Mine are not a priori more correct than someone
else's.  This does not mean however that I must judge another on the
basis of his rather than my moral standards.  While he is entitled to
believe what his own moral sense tells him, the rest of society is
entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is
offensive to the majority.
