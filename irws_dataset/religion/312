Baptism and Faith

In baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ through a
personal faith in the power of God.  Our parent's faith cannot do this.

So then we receive God's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the
gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.  Kids
are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to
respond to God's word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot
be raised in baptism to a new life.
