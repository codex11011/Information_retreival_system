Who is a Christian?

If one does not follow the teachings of Christ, he is NOT a Christian.  
That would exclude most self-proclaimed "Christians." 

I will not be so proud as to boast that my faith is 100%. I am still human
and imperfect and therefore, liable to sin.  Thankfully, there is
opportunity for repentence and forgiveness.

Did Jesus define what "striving" means? Can you give an example of striving 
that is insufficient to qualify one as a Christian and thus condemns one 
to eternal damnation in fiery torture? Do you self-proclaim yourself a
Christian and if so on what basis?
