Should Christians fight war?

As Christians, we are not supposed to defend ourselves.
War is a result of sin. Defense may be a necessary reaction to an
attack, but I don't think that we as Christians should take part in
this.

What if you are trying to defend someone else.  Should you allow killing and
oppression to continue, or is it our obligation to protect the innocent?
