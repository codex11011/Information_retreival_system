Faith and Dogma

Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on
faith alone, which by its nature is without justification.  That
is what I mean by the word 'faith': belief without justification, or
belief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational)
justification.

Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based
on new information, or increased mental faculty.

A philosopher cannot be a Christian because a philosopher can change his mind,
whereas a Christian cannot, due to the nature of faith and dogma present
in any religion.
