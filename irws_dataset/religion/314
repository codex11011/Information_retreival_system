Is it Biblical that Satan was kicked out of heaven?

I have a question about Satan.  I was taught a long time ago
that Satan was really an angel of God and was kicked out of heaven
because he challenged God's authority.  The problem is, I cannot
find this in the Bible.  Is it Biblical?

As someone mentioned earlier, from the apocryphal Book of Enoch,
Satan was apparently kicked out for three times asserting his own will,
"I will".

Then there are the references around the Bible about taking a third
of the angels, getting a third of the heavens or something.
