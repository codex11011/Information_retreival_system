Can a theist be truly objective?

Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial
when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or
will he assume the superstition of his parents
when questioning? 

I've often found it to be the case that the theist
will stick to some kind of superstition when
wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've
seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,
and the other theists alike.  All assume that
their mothers and fathers were right in the
aspect that a God exists, and with that belief
search for their God.
