Origins of the Bible

I have been having an argument about the origins of the bible lately with
a theist acquaintance.  He stated that thousands of bibles were discovered
at a certain point in time which were syllable-perfect.  This therefore
meant that there must have been one copy at a certain time; the time quoted
by my acquaintance was approximately 50 years after the death of Jesus.
