Arrogance

Arrogance is arrogance.  It is not the result of religion, it is the result
of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one's desire to show
others of one's rightness.  I assume that God decided to be judge for our
sake as much as his own, if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the 
judge, we'll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged 
ourselves.
