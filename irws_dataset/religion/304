Everlasting Life of the New Testament

Catholics believe that what Adam primarily lost by his sin, for
himself and the human race, was sanctifying grace.  This is basically
a share in the Divine life.  Take a rock and make it able to talk.
What God does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar.
It makes one able to live on a plane that is above the powers
of any possible creature.  This is the "everlasting life" that the New
Testament speaks of.
