Is God sadist?

The only problem with this is that Jesus does use hell as a threat.
He doesn't sound like some of the more extreme fire and brimstone
preachers, and I don't think he wants people to live in abject fear.
But he talks a lot about people being found unworthy, and mentions
Hell a number of times.  I agree that it might be more pleasant to
think that it doesn't exist.  I certainly don't agree that God is some
sort of sadist who tortures people forever.  But I am very much afraid
that there really is a life and death spiritual struggle going on, and
that it is possible for people to lose in a serious way.
