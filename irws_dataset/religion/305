Why do people become atheists?

I am interested in finding out why people become
atheists after having believed in some God.
In conversing with them on other groups, I've
often sensed anger or hostility.   Though I don't
mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile,
it does seem to be one motivation for giving up
faith.  Thus, some atheism might result from 
brokenness.
