WANTED: $10 for Polaroid Palette 72-10 Manual

I need the Polaroid Palette Model 72-10 (or similar model) manual.
I am willing to pay $10 for it, plus the shipping charge via USPS 3rd
class.

I don't need the original one, photo-copyed manual will just be fine for
me. If you have the manual, please help me out.
